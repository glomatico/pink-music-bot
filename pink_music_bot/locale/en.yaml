    <b>👋 Hello</b> 
    
    I'm a bot that downloads songs and music videos from Apple Music in high quality:
    • Songs: AAC 256kbps, ALAC up to 24-bit/192kHz, Dolby Atmos, or Binaural AAC 256kbps
    • Music Videos: H.264 1080p or H.265 4K with AAC 256kbps audio
    
    Just send me Apple Music links (song, music video, album, or playlist) and I'll send you the files. Up to 3 links per message will be processed. Once a download starts, wait until it finishes before starting another.

    <b>💲 Membership</b>
    
    Free users get {free_daily_credits} downloads per day (songs only, AAC format). Members enjoy:
    • Unlimited daily downloads
    • Music video downloads

    • Priority processing queue

    <b>📝 Important</b>
